        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Root vegetable lovers rejoice! This dish not only features chunks of roasted root vegetables, but there are pureed root veggies in the sauce, too. Follow the recipe closely, or use your own combination of root vegetables, including rutabaga and celery (though you may want to avoid beets unless you want pink mac ’n cheese). You will need about 3 pounds in total. MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Moderate</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup oat groats</li>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped pecans</li>
            <li>Date Syrup (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The night before, bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the oat groats, cover, and return to a boil for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Set aside, covered, until morning.</li>
            <li>The next morning, return the covered saucepan to the stovetop. Remove the lid and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the oats are tender and heated through.</li>
            <li>If all the water is absorbed before the oats become tender, add up to ½ cup of additional water and continue to cook while stirring occasionally for a few more minutes until tender.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the bananas and add to the oats along with the nutmeg. Cook, stirring, over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to combine and blend the flavors. To serve, spoon into serving bowls and sprinkle with chopped pecans and a swirl of Date Syrup (if using).</li>
        </ol>

ROOT VEGETABLES
1 parsnip, cut into 1-inch dice
1 carrot, cut into 1-inch dice
1 sweet potato, cut into 1-inch dice
1 Yukon Gold potato, cut into 1-inch dice
½ cup chopped yellow onion
½ teaspoon onion powder
¼ teaspoon ground black pepper
MAC ’N CHEESE
2 cups Light Vegetable Broth (here), or more as needed
½ cup nutritional yeast
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
1 teaspoon white miso paste
1 teaspoon salt-free stone-ground mustard
½ teaspoon onion powder
½ teaspoon garlic powder
½ teaspoon smoked paprika
¼ teaspoon grated fresh turmeric, or ¼ teaspoon ground
8 ounces whole-grain or bean-based elbow macaroni or other bite-size pasta of your choice

FOR THE ROOT VEGETABLES: Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Line two baking pans with silicone mats or parchment paper.
Divide the vegetables evenly in a single layer between the two prepared pans. Sprinkle with onion powder and black pepper. Roast until the vegetables are tender and slightly caramelized, 45 to 60 minutes, turning the veggies with a metal spatula about halfway through. When the vegetables are done roasting, remove them from the oven and set aside.”


FOR THE MAC ’N CHEESE: Put 2 cups of the roasted vegetables into a high-powered blender. Add the Light Vegetable Broth, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, miso paste, mustard, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and turmeric. Blend until very smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if necessary. Add more broth if needed to reach your desired consistency. Set the sauce aside.
Cook the macaroni according to package instructions in a large pot of boiling water until al dente. Drain well and return to the pot. Add the remaining roasted vegetables and the sauce, stirring gently over low heat to combine and heat through. Serve hot.
