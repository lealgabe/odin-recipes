        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup oat groats</li>
            <li>2 ripe bananas</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped pecans</li>
            <li>Date Syrup (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The night before, bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the oat groats, cover, and return to a boil for 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat. Set aside, covered, until morning.</li>
            <li>The next morning, return the covered saucepan to the stovetop. Remove the lid and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, for 6 to 8 minutes, or until the oats are tender and heated through.</li>
            <li>If all the water is absorbed before the oats become tender, add up to ½ cup of additional water and continue to cook while stirring occasionally for a few more minutes until tender.</li>
            <li>Peel and chop the bananas and add to the oats along with the nutmeg. Cook, stirring, over low heat for 1 to 2 minutes to combine and blend the flavors. To serve, spoon into serving bowls and sprinkle with chopped pecans and a swirl of Date Syrup (if using).</li>
